VB6 Business Objects/VB6 Distributed Objects Code
=================================================
This repo contains the code for Rockford Lhotka's *Visual Basic 6 Business Objects* and *Visual Basic 6 Distributed Objects* books.

**Author's note:**
 
I thought this code was lost. After Wrox Press went bankrupt in the early 2000's I thought the code was lost, but I recently found it lurking on an Internet site and thought it would be wise to put it into a GitHub repo.

About once a year someone emails me asking for this code, so I'm happy that I'll finally be able to provide a useful link to the source.
